## Portfolio
As a professional educator holding a master's degree in Child Studies and a diploma in Computer Science, I combine pedagogical expertise with technical proficiency and strong analytical skills for written communication. Through dedicated practice, my knowledge in content creation and technical documentation has developed significantly. To improve my skills in Markdown and XML, I maintain two blog sites via GitHub. My writing primarily focuses on content creation and documentation practices for software development. For content development, I utilize editing tools including GarageBand, LumaFusion, and Canva, selected for their efficient workflows, mobility and functionality.

Originally from Indonesia, I am a native speaker of both Javanese and Indonesian languages. During my high school education, I developed a strong proficiency in English. Since 2016, I have been expanding my linguistic capabilities with Swedish as my fourth language while establishing my life in Sweden.
