# About Hestu 
Hi! My name is Hestu. I am a mom and teacher who has a passion for writing, multilingualism, and a keen interest in technology, with a master's degree in Child Studies and a diploma in Computer Science.

My teaching background has shaped my approach to educational design. I weave creativity, problem-solving, and lifelong learning into all my work. My classroom experience showed me how learners thrive when learning is engaging, practical, and connected to real-world challenges. This insight drives me to create learning experiences that go beyond information delivery â€” helping learners practice, reflect, and build confidence in meaningful ways.

In addition to teaching, I create mindfulness and motivational content. I use editing tools like GarageBand and Canva, chosen for their efficient workflows, mobility, and functionality.

Originally from Indonesia, I am a native speaker of both Javanese and Indonesian. My interest in languages has motivated me to develop strong proficiency in English. Since 2016, I have been expanding my linguistic capabilities with Swedish as my fourth language while establishing my life in Sweden.
