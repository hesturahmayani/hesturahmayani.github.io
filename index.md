## Portfolio
My pedagogical expertise has grown along with my technical proficiency and strong analytical skills. I often help my colleagues with scheduling in Excel, technical problems in email or Windows, and printer networking. 

During my spare time, I am actively writing a mindfulness and meditation newsletter since August 2024, now reaching 48 subscribers. For content development, I utilize editing tools including GarageBand, LumaFusion, and Canva, selected for their efficient workflows, mobility, and functionality.

With my interest in technology, I am improving my skills in technical writing by maintaining two blog sites via GitHub. One of the blogs primarily focuses on content creation and documentation practices for software development.

Originally from Indonesia, I am a native speaker of both Javanese and Indonesian. My interest in languages has motivated me to develop strong proficiency in English. Since 2016, I have been expanding my linguistic capabilities with Swedish as my fourth language while establishing my life in Sweden.
